      <p id="p01" title="What i am good at !!">
      Skilled workers have long had historical import (see Division of labor) as masons, carpenters, blacksmiths, bakers, brewers, coopers, printers and other occupations that are economically productive. Skilled workers were often politically active through their craft guilds.<br/>
      Life skills are problem solving behaviors used appropriately and responsibly in the management of personal affairs. They are a set of human skills acquired via learning (teaching) or direct experience that are used to handle problems and questions commonly encountered in daily human life. The subject varies greatly depending on societal norms and community expectations.<br/>

        <h3 class="skills">&bull;Website Development&bull;</h3>
        <p>Though i do not know much about website development, but my first attempt helped me achieve something around what i had expected.</p><br/>

          <iframe src="notepadutil/newuser.html" width="900" height="500"></iframe>
        </div>


        <h3 class="skills">&bull;Bash Scripting&bull;</h3>
        <p>It was after i realised thwe power of bash that i got inclined towards it.I am quite good at bash scripting.That&rsquo;it. </p>

        <h3 class="skills">&bull;Metalworking&bull;</h3>
        <p>Metalworking has all the benefits of woodworking, except instead of the sweet smell of sawdust, you surround yourself with the delightfully noxious smell of burning metal. I picked up metal working in my 9th Grade. And in still continue pursuing it.</p>

        <h3 class="skills">&bull;Collecting&bull;</h3>
        <p>Collecting things is something a lot of men love and most women just don&rsquo;t get. Females are multi-taskers, while the male brain likes to single-mindedly zero in on something. We tend to get obsessed with things. Take this tendency and couple it with man&rsquo;s primordial desire for the hunt, and there you have a man&rsquo;s love for collecting. A man can spend a lifetime looking for that final item to complete his collection. It becomes his obsession.Of course, completing a collection is usually anti-climatic. In collecting, the thrill is in the chase. Pick your poison. Duck stamps, baseball cards, antique typewriters, whatever. Just don&rsquo;t get too carried away with it. </p>

        <h3 class="skills">&bull;Photography&bull;</h3>
        <p>If you&rsquo;ve always wanted to pick up an art, but don&rsquo;t have the painter&rsquo;s touch, try photography. With digital cameras and digital editing software becoming cheaper, photography as a hobby is more popular and accessible than ever. One benefit of photography as a hobby is that you can combine other interests with it. Love the outdoors? Snap some nature photos while on your hike. </p>

        <h3 class="skills">&bull;Drawing and Painting&bull;</h3>
        <p>Painting requires a bit more set up and cost depending on the type of painting you want to do. Watercolor painting is cheaper (and easier to clean up) than oil painting. Most hobby and art stores provide drawing and painting classes. If you&rsquo;re too cheap for that, you can always watch the man with the greatest white-man fro in history,</p>


        <h3 class="skills">&bull;Amateur Astronomy&bull;</h3>
        <p>Space. The final frontier. While you might not be able to actually visit space, you can still get caught up in its awe and majesty right from your backyard. You&rsquo;d be surprised what sorts of things you can see in space with a small telescope or even a pair of high powered binoculars. If you really want to see deep into space, you&rsquo;ll need to get a high powered telescope which of course will set you back a thousand dollars or so. But the payoff may come when you spot something in your backyard observatory that even the big dogs at NASA haven&rsquo;t caught; amateur astronomers have made several big discoveries. And remember that astronomy is more than just looking in a telescope; it&rsquo;s also learning as much as you can about our wondrous universe from books, shows, and lectures.</p>

        <h3 class="skills">&bull;Computer Programming&bull;</h3>
        <p> Many men have made computer programming their living, but there are millions more who have day jobs but pound out code in their spare time just for kicks and giggles. These are the people who make silly online games, useful open source apps, and cool web projects. There&rsquo;s a variety of code languages you can learn. Personally, I picked programming in my 10th Grade and I&rsquo;m fond of web programming and have found W3Schools a great resource to learn PHP, SQL, and CSS completely for free.
